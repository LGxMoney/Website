		Welcome to my custom website! This was built directly from HTML, CSS, and eventually other languages like PHP, JavaSript, 			and a few others. This site is hosted through Truman's Ice Server. This site is to serve as a portfolio of many of my 			projects, achievements,and hardwork. Find out more about me by navigating the different pages including: art, technology, 			business, and contact. The art page will feature a gallery of painting that will eventually be dynamic and more interactive. The Technology page currently acts as a portfolio of projects I have worked on. Eventually, this page will feature research linked to a database as well as more javascrip to make it more dynamic. The business page is meant to act as a medium to order various things from my site. This will eventually be done throught PHP form processing. Lastly, we have the static contact page to serve as a general collection of ways to reach me. Also check me out on social media by clicking on the links below!
