        <p> <img class="featureimg" alt="software" src="imgs/software.jpeg">
            Creating projects and designing software is a big hobby of mine outside of college related assignments. 
            I find myself exploring new ideas and creating software that is useful to my lifestyle. I have branched into multiple different areas of software like graphics, games, mathy-problem solving, and some product design. Trying to find out what best interests me within the field is something that is very difficult to do considering how broad Computer Science and software can be. The best approach for me is to keep trying to different things and seeing what I like best! Below you fill find 
            a couple projects that I have worked out outside of school.<br/><br/>

<img class="subimage" src="imgs/ballsim.png" alt="ball simultator" width="140" height="120">
Using Java and messing around with various libraries and packages, I was able to create a simultation of a ball bouncing around inside of a box. The logic of the ball revolves around the position of it between frames and updates. Every frame, the ball calculates a new position based off of it's current speed or change in a certain direction. When you add action handlers to increment or decrement the speed of the ball (either in the negative or positive direction), you can gain control of the ball throught the arrows.

My introduction to web design began in FBLA when I decided to take on the Webdesign prompt of designing an online bike store. I used WordPress to get familiar with how the aesthetic and flow of web pages work. I took a webdesign course in highschool as well that taught me basic HTML and CSS. Through this, I have learned to create websites. The very website you are looking at now is completely coded from HTML and CSS pages. Eventually, it will implement PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, and XML!

As a first-year college student, I was given the assignment to create a structure in Java that would support a Tic Tac Toe game. Using a 2-Dimensional array and a variety of if statements to check what spaces were available, I was able to create an AI using a random spot picker as an opponent. Since then, I took the Java program to the next level and made the computer smarter than the average player. With given strategies and tactics, only skilled players can beat my now artificially intellgient program (it also depends on who starts!)

I began to wonder this as well, thus incentivising me to develop a Words/Minute Calculator first on my laptop. Using Java, I have begun writing code to record the time it takes to write a randomly generated sentence. I will take this average and record it. Eventually, I hope to deploy an app to record the same data. Once this is done, we can finally find out which is quantifiably faster!

		<img class="featureimg" alt="Tronxy P802Ma" src="hardware/Tronxy/printerprofile.JPG">
                One of my favorite CS related hobbies is 3D printing. In January of 2017, I ordered over 150 pieces of hardware
                from China to start building my own 3D printer. The collective unit is called the Tronxy p802Ma Rep Rap printer. These type of printers are extremely cheap compared to other soley because they require the customer to build them piece by piece and wire by wire. I use my printer for my various hobbies varying from musical instruments to hardware projects and sometimes even business ventures. Below you will see some featured projects I have worked on with my printer. If you are interestedin having something custom made, please email me!

<p>These cases are just fun to design, easy to tweak, and don't take that long to print. Many people ask me to print them cases for these very reasons! On top of that, they are extremely customizable and can be made for anyone's brand of phone. 
			<ul>
				<li>Tri-Beta Cases: A set of designs for BBB's phone case order</li>
				<li>Fun Cases: A series of fun and experimental phone cases to test my printer's limits </li>
				<li>Truman Cases: A set of cases designed to advertise Truman! Featuring purple painting and a polyeurothane coat </li>

                    <h3>Instruments</h3>
<p> Music has always been a passion of mine and when I first got my 3D printer, I really wanted to try making some instruments with it. My first print was an ocarina that didn't sound incredibly good at first. Some time after that, I decided to print an entire ukelele with 4 separate parts that had to be glued together. It came together and with some touching up and painting, it was actually functional!
			<ul>
				<li>Ukelele: A white and blue painted ukelele completely 3D printed with the exception of tuning pegs and strings</li>
				<li>Ocarina: A black 12 hole ocarina of time that plays nearly in tune! </li>
				<li>Reed Pipes: 7 varyious sized pipes that when blown across play different pitches</li>

                My scope so far includes hardware relating to: arduino microcontrollers, photoresistors, piezo elements (and buzzers), leds, servo motors,
                IR led and recievers, RF transmitters and recievers, and LCD screens. I hope to continue exploring the huge field of electronics and push

                        <h3>Knock-Sensor</h3>
			<p>
			Being a student advisor at Truman, I have people wanting to hang out in my room quite often. That along with having a girlfriend means that my 'always locked door' usually needs to be unlocked. With only having one key, I came up with a solution to this problem. If I place a piezo disc on one side of the door hooked up to a stepper motor, 3D printed gear-set, and arduino nano, I can create my knock-sensor. When the correct rhythm of knock is detected, the arduino lets the stepper motor know it can push down on the handle and let the person on the other side in. The code could easily be motified to have a rotating knock-key to make sure people passing by don't know my knock-key. (This source code below is not the source code that I actually use for my project - this is the code that inspired the project however)

/* Knock Sensor

   This sketch reads a piezo element to detect a knocking sound.
   It reads an analog pin and compares the result to a set threshold.
   If the result is greater than the threshold, it writes
   "knock" to the serial port, and toggles the LED on pin 13.

   The circuit:
    * + connection of the piezo attached to analog in 0
    * - connection of the piezo attached to ground
    * 1-megohm resistor attached from analog in 0 to ground

                    	<h3>Laser Security:</h3>
			<p>
			Using an arduino nano with a photoresistor, piezo element, and 75kOhm resistor, I was able to create a very annoying and alarming siren sound when the reciever doesn't collect enough light. When powered, it immediately starts it's alarm. The purpose of this device is to line up a laser with the photoresistor so that it is satisfied with the light level. We can use this by setting the laser and reciever up in a confined space and when broken, it sounds an alarm. I originally had this set up in my doorway for when I left my dorm room opened.

			This is one of my all time favorite projects I have worked on! It incorporates a OLED display, coin batteries, arduino nano, lots of soldering, a leather bracelet, an IR LED, and a really cool 3D printed case! This beast can change the output of the IR just like a normal remote, except it was built from scratch and sits on your wrist.
